​
## About
​
As the world advances in technology, our society finds itself slowly lacking the human-to-human interactions that fulfills our need for belongingness. Without that need fulfilled, our society enters the age of loneliness, which is an emotional state that may lead to many mental health issues. 
​
The Pavilion Team is formed to establish Pavilion, an easy-to-use, social platform which gathers individuals with common enjoyable interests to form groups and a sense of belonging. To learn more, visit the demo of the platform on [Heroku](https://pavilionbyllk.herokuapp.com/).
